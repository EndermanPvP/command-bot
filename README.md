**QUESTIONS:**

**How to install?** Type "node i discord.js" in the file location. **How to add commands?**
It's actually very simple. You can copy the last line of command. **There is an error, What should I do?**
You can DM me on Discord and send me the code. Discord: `EndermanPvP#0001`. **Is this safe?**
Yes! You can view the code and look into it. **Should I run this on my Computer?**
It's not recommended but you can. I recommend checking out a Discord Bot hosting. e.g. https://revivenode.com/discord.html, or any preferred hosting service.
